# Copilot Instructions for Idle-RPG

## Project Overview
Idle-RPG is a project designed to provide an engaging idle role-playing game experience. The architecture and implementation details are currently minimal, but this document will guide AI coding agents to contribute effectively.

## Key Guidelines

### 1. Code Structure
- **Main Components**: The project structure is not yet defined. As the project evolves, ensure that new components are modular and adhere to clear separation of concerns.
- **File Naming**: Use descriptive and consistent file names that reflect their purpose.

### 2. Development Workflow
- **Branching**: Always create a new branch for your changes and submit a pull request for review.
- **Commits**: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the "what" and "why" of your changes.

### 3. Coding Conventions
- **Language**: Follow best practices for the programming language(s) used in this project.
- **Documentation**: Document all functions, classes, and modules with clear and concise comments.

### 4. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- **Test Framework**: Use the testing framework specified in the project (if any).

### 5. External Dependencies
- **Package Management**: Use a package manager (e.g., npm, pip) to handle external dependencies. Document any new dependencies added.

### 6. Communication
- **Pull Requests**: Provide a detailed description of your changes in pull requests, including the problem being solved and the approach taken.
- **Issues**: Reference related issues in your pull request or commit messages.

## Examples
- **Adding a New Feature**: Create a new module or component, write unit tests, and document the feature in the README or relevant documentation files.
- **Fixing a Bug**: Write a test that reproduces the bug, fix the issue, and ensure all tests pass.

## Future Updates
As the project grows, this document will be updated to reflect new conventions, workflows, and architectural decisions.
